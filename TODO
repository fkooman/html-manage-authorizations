- MANAGEMENT WEB INTERFACE
  - make it impossible to remove/edit the management client through the
    webinterface to make it impossible to lock yourself out.
  - implement a approval/token revoke dialog in the manage interface (next to 
    client administration, for normal users)
  - for "web application" clients a secret is needed, for other clients no
    - hide it in the interface when switching the select box for client profile
